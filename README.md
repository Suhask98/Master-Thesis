# Master-Thesis
This repo is for all ipynb files used for master thesis. <br><br>
Firstly the pipeline_model.ipynb consists of the most accurate model with respect to F1 and weighted F1 score. <br>
The bert_implemented notebook has BERT implemented from a custom class. The notebook is also designed to work on GPU or CPU based on availability. <br>
The word embedding model notebooks such as word2vec, GloVe, and fastText do not generalize the training set well and hence these models werent used on AWS. The ms-teams notebook has all the API keys along with the links for extracting data for android and iOS. The key's in principal would expire on march 31, 2024. The documentation for API can be found in the following websites. In any case, if anything doesnt work, chatGPT or the support team from each of these companies can assist.<br>
The training set where all these models have been trained and tested upon has been uploaded too, its consists reviews taken from september 1, 2022. <br>
