# Master-Thesis
This repo is for all ipynb files used for master thesis. <br><br>
Firstly the pipeline_model.ipynb consists of the most accurate model with respect to F1 and weighted F1 score. <br>
The bert_implemented notebook has BERT implemented from a custom class. The notebook is also designed to work on GPU or CPU based on availability. <br>
The word embedding model notebooks such as word2vec, GloVe, and fastText do not generalize the training set well and hence these models werent implemented on AWS.  <br>
